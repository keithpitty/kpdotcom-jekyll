A section of the front of a card that was kindly given to me by my Envato colleagues last week

## It's Time

Yes, today's the day.

Not only do I turn 65 today but it's the day on which I have chosen to retire. Even if 
the Australian government has changed their mind about the age when one can get the
age pension (it's now 67), if 65 was a good enough age for my late father to retire, it's
good enough for me.

And, yes, I feel it's time. Whilst I've derived a lot of satisfaction from various roles
throughout my career, it's fair to say that I'm tired and ready for a break from work.

## A Privilege

I'm mindful that I've been lucky. During my career I've had the opportunity to learn
much about the application of software in various industries, and seen many advances
in technology. Since 2008 I've been privileged to be able to work remotely and, during
the last few years, enjoy developing my skills as an Engineering Manager.

I also feel privileged, after more than 40 years as a computing professional, to be able
to retire at this point in history. It's a turbulent time. The advent of AI-powered
engineering as well as the disruption of many types of work by AI has created more
uncertainty for those seeking to continue or even commence working in software engineering.

I know I'm lucky.

## What's next?

I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family, especially my two adorable
grandchildren. In time, I expect to enjoy travelling with my wife. It goes without
saying that I'm looking forward to playing more golf, watching more cricket and Aussie
Rules football.

Essentially though, I'm looking forward to having the time to explore the many hobbies that
I've not had much time for to date. And having an afternoon nap whenever I feel like it!

I guess it's fair to say that I won't feel able to totally remove myself from the world
of software engineering. I imagine I'll spend some time tinkering with technologies that
interest me, like the [Ash framework](https://ash-hq.org/) ... when I feel like it.

And, oh yes, I have committed to reflecting more on my career and writing the odd blog
post. So, if you've read this far, and remain curious, watch this space.
