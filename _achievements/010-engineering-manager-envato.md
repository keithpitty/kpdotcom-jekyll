heading: Engineering Manager, Envato (2021 - 2025)
---

I joined [Envato](https://envato.com/) in July 2021 in the role of an
Engineering Manager. Read on to learn more of my achievements, which are
listed in reverse chronological order.

For the last couple of months before my retirement, following a
restructure, I focussed on assisting the formation of the Elements
Platform team. A key aspect of my contribution was facilitating the
adaptation of processes for this team and the new domain within which
it operated.

For three months in early 2025, I managed an additional team within
the Search and Content Management domain. My role was essentially to
strengthen this team before handing it over to a new Engineering Manager.

From July 2024 until October 2025 I managed a team
within the Search and Content Management domain.

During this time I:

- managed six direct reports
- collaborated with a Product Manager, Lead Designer and Lead Engineer
to review, track and plan the team's progress on specific initiatives
- demonstrated accountability for the team's delivery plans
- oversaw the team's delivery of Envato's
[Sounds Like search](https://www.envato.com/blog/find-your-perfect-music-match-with-envatos-sounds-like-search/)
feature
- oversaw the team's delivery of more Music Uplift and Search initiatives
- facilitated the organisation of shared maintenance of two core applications
across several teams within the Search and Content Management domain

In mid-2022, following a company-wide restructure, I briefly moved to a 
Tech Services team before moving to the Market team.

During my time in the Market team, I:

- managed six direct reports
- co-managed the Market team
- contributed to improvements in the team's processes
- collaborated with the team's Product Manager to plan, prioritise
  and track maintenance, tactical and strategic initiatives
- collaborated with another Engineering Manager to introduce more
  Engineers to the on-call roster
- provided guidance to Engineers who have been leading initiatives
- facilitated Envato's sponsorship of, and involvement in RubyConf AU 2023
- facilitated Envato's Tech Leadership Book Club
- collaborated with others to improve Envato's Incident Management
  capabilities

From July 2021 until June 2023 I co-managed the Growth Infrastructure team.
My work included:

-   managing seven direct reports
-   sharing the management of the Growth Infrastructure team with another
    Engineering Manager
-   leading improvements to the team’s workflow processes
-   giving a presentation to leaders within the Engineering cohort about
    the team’s use of the AWS Cloud Development Kit
-   developing working relationships with vendors
-   facilitating the revision of on-call and technical support rosters
-   hiring new Site Reliability Engineers and introducing them to Envato
    and the Growth Infrastructure team
-   facilitating team retrospectives
-   familiarising myself with the infrastructure that the team’s SREs
    supported
